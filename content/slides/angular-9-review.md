Presentation from Angular Tricity meetup - Gdansk, Poland.
I discuss what we can expect from Angular 9 release and why it is huge accomplishment for the team.
I've given few tips how we managed to migrate with 6 file-changes (even when schematic migration modified 420 files)

At last, few speculations on close future of Angular.
