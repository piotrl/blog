Front-end ops engineer

Required skills:

- Strong JavaScript and TypeScript fundamentals,
- Experienced in JavaScript build tools like webpack or babel,
- Experienced in NodeJs ecosystem around tooling

Nice to have:

* Experience in Angular tooling ecosystem like Angular CLI, Angular Schematics, Angular webpack config
* Experience in `Nx` toolset for Angular
* Writing unit-tests for build process? This would be great addition



What you'll work on:

* Enhancing developer experience for 100 UI developers working on our main product
* Optimising build times for local and production bundles for healthy CI
* Improving unit-tests infrastructure with jest
* Ensuring right code quality with eslint and tslint
* Optimising runtime and bootstraping of our UI application

What you won't work on:

* Configuring CI or Kubernetes on its own



### Current Core UI responsibilities around development experience:

I'm skipping Ops responsibilities here like Introducing metrics and measurement of the stability of the UI app in production + error handling. 

I think there are two kinds of responsibilities: Ops and build. We ensure that UI app (GWT and Angular) does not break and it's fast as it should; Analyse issues of runtime; Maintaining tooling to build and deploy application;

Active :

* Maintaining core libraries upgrades (Angular, TypeScript, security updates on utility libraries)
* Review adding new JavaScript libraries to the project and updating existing (usually MaintananceAdaptive)
* Prepare tooling infrastructure for i18n (partially shared with DEP)
* Maintain and extend monorepo structure for Angular
* Maintenance adaptive (e.g. code migrations to support new compiler of Angular)

Extinguished due to lack of time:
(happens only when hot issue arises)

* IntelliJ set-up for Angular developers
* Maintaining dev-tools libraries: Updates and migrations
* Building code generators for common boilerplate blocks (e.g. pages, libraries)
* Migrations to newer JavaScript targets
* Unit test infrastructure for Angular
* App runtime performance improvmenets by proper tooling configuration
* Optimising bundle size by the proper tooling adjustments
* Optimising compilation time for local development
